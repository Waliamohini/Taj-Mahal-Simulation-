# Taj-Mahal-Simulation-
In this project we have simulated Taj Mahal, This our project based learning project for our Subject : GT &amp; GPU.

🕌 Taj Mahal in C (Graphics Project)
This project is a graphical representation of the Taj Mahal, implemented in C language using the classic Turbo C++ graphics library (graphics.h). The architecture is drawn with detailed elements like domes, pillars, windows, gates, trees, stairs, and even reflections, all created manually with primitive graphics functions.

🎨 Preview
A beautiful simulation of the iconic Taj Mahal using 2D graphics functions such as line(), rectangle(), ellipse(), circle(), floodfill(), and fillpoly().

<!-- Optional: Add a screenshot of the output if you want -->
